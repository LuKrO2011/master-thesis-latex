		Deep learning-based models are achieving increasingly superior accuracy in classifying the readability of code.
		% Background
		Recent research focuses mostly on different model architectures to further improve code readability classification. The models mostly use (parts of) the same labeled dataset, consisting of 421 code snippets.

		In this work, we investigate the use of a new dataset consisting of \numSamples code snippets together with its novel generation approach.
		% Main results	
		The generation approach involves the extraction and modification of code snippets from public GitHub repositories. The generated dataset is evaluated using a survey with 200 participants and by training a state of the art code readability classification model both with and without the new dataset.
		% Context of results
		In the future, our dataset might increase the accuracy of all readability classification models.
		
		% Old abstract:
		%		We present an innovative method for generating datasets intended for code readability classification in the context of a master's thesis. We offer a comprehensive overview of code readability, delving into existing classifiers that consider both manually crafted and automatically extracted code readability features. Furthermore, we summarize existing datasets of manually annotated Java code snippets.
		%		
		%		The core contribution of this work lies in the introduction of an automatic data generation technique, alongside a dataset produced using this methodology. Our approach relies on the extraction and modification of code snippets sourced from public GitHub repositories. Notably, our dataset significantly surpasses the scale of any previously available dataset designed for readability classification.
		%		
		%		To evaluate the newly generated dataset, we conducted a user survey and train a state of the art code readability classification model, both with and without the integration of the new dataset. This analysis aims to assess the quality of our new dataset and the effectiveness of the generation approach employed.

\section{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

	% Motivation: Importance
	Code readability is of utmost significance in the domain of software development.
	In the domain of software development, the significance of code readability cannot be overstated. Together with understandability, it serves as the foundation for efficient collaboration, comprehension, and maintenance of software systems~\cite{posnett2011simpler, aggarwal2002integrated}. 
	Maintenance alone will consume over 70~\% of the total lifecycle cost of a software product and for maintenance, the most time-consuming act is reading code~\cite{buse2009learning, deimel1985uses, rugaber2000use, boehm2001defect}.
	Therefore, it is important to ensure a high readability of code. In order to archive this, we need to measure readability.
	% Motivation: Current state
	In the last years, researchers have proposed several metrics and models for assessing code readability with an accuracy of up to 81.8~\%~\citeclassicmodels. In recent years, deep learning-based models are able to achieve an accuracy of up to 88.0~\%~\citedeepmodels.
	
	% Main problem
	%	However, these models do not capture what developers think of readability improvements~\cite{fakhoury2019improving}. This suggests that there is room for improvement in readability classification of source code. 
	However, a major limitation of these models is not their architecture, but the amount of available data for Java code readability classification, which comprises 421 code snippets~\citeolddataset. The current training data originates from questionnaires, where humans have manually labeled the code snippets. This has two drawbacks: Firstly, manual labeling requires a lot of effort. Secondly, the dataset is too small for deep learning, as those require 
	To address those drawbacks, we aim to automatically generate more training data.
	
	% Problem details
	% Effects of more data
	Deep learning-based models perform better the more training data they get~\cite{hestness2017deep}. Therefore, one approach to further improve existing models is to gather more training data.
	% Effort of studys
	This requires, as it was done previously, a lot of effort and persons willing to rate code based on their readability.
	
	% Approach
	The main idea of this work is to investigate whether it is possible to achieve higher accuracy in code readability classification using automatically generated data. 
	%	Instead of introducing a new model, we will try to achieve this with more training data. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to data generation for code readability classification. We will evaluate such a generated dataset using a survey and by comparing the accuracy of the model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} trained on the old and the new data.

A presentation of classical computational approaches is presented in \autoref{Conventional Calculation Approaches}, followed by an overview of deep learning-based approaches in \autoref{Deep Learning Based Approaches}. Furthermore, in \autoref{Data Augmentation}, we provide insights into relevant studies dealing with data augmentation for code readability.

	%	% Conclusion
	%	In the last section we summarize our work, draw conclusions from it and propose future work.
	
	% Dataset generation
	In a first step, following the approach of \citeauthor{allamanis2016convolutional}~\cite{allamanis2016convolutional}, we download GitHub\curl{https://github.com/}{2024-02-29} repositories with high code quality.
	Our criteria for high code quality are an elevated number of stars, forks, method comments the use of and compliance with a checkstyle\curl{https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/}{2024-02-09} specification. For example, developers prefer high code quality and therefore star or fork repositories with high code quality more likely.
	We select Java files from the repositories that meet our criteria and extract methods from the Java classes in these files and label them as well readable (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption}).
	
	% TODO Generell: In papern machen wir gern eine Grafik auf die erste Seite, die den Ansatz direkt erklärt. Du hast ja eh listing 1 und 2. Theoretisch könntest du die hier schon einbinden und eine Figure draus machen mit links "good code", rechts "manipulated code"
	
	In a second step, all selected Java files are manipulated so that its code is subsequently less readable. You can find an exemplary result of this in TODO.
	We extract methods from the Java classes in these files and label them as poorly readable (Assumption \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}).
	
	After both steps, we have a new, automatically generated dataset for code readability classification. We call it minded-and-modified dataset.
	
	% Readabililty Decreasing Heuristics
	How can we manipulate code so that it is less readable afterwards? We introduce a tool called Readability Decreasing Heuristics. This is a collection of heuristics that, when applied to Java files, lower the readability of it. Such heuristics are replacing spaces with newlines or increasing the indentation of a code block by a tab or multiple spaces. Most changes also decrease readability when applied in reverse (replacing newlines with spaces, decreasing indentation).
	
	Methods in Java are syntactically the same, before and after applying Readability Decreasing Heuristics. Functionality does not change either. However, if various modifications are applied many times, those changes are capable of lowering the readability of source code, as TODO suggests.
	%	the comparison of \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils} and \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils-modified} suggests.

%	% Study goals
%	To verify whether the well-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption}) and the poorly-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}) hold we conducted a survey on Prolific.
%	% Study details
%	We ask Java programmers to rate methods that were mined and modified. Therefore, human annotators rated each code snippet with a readability score. The annotators are selected by Prolific\curl{https://www.prolific.scom/}{2023-09-30}. The readability rating is based on a five-point Likert scale~\cite{likert1932technique} ranging from one (i.e., very unreadable) to five (i.e., very readable). We apply the same rating as done previously~\citeolddataset, but, other than before, we will not use the rating for labeling the training data. Instead, we only use the ratings to validate some randomly selected methods to confirm our assumptions (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption} and \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}). All snippets are automatically labeled.
%	
%	% Model comparison details
%	Besides the user study we will evaluate our approach by comparing performance of the towards model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} when trained with the new and the old dataset.
%	The comparisons are based on common metrics such as accuracy, F1-score and MCC~\cite{chicco2020advantages}.
%	% The towards model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} achieves an accuracy of 91.8\% when trained and evaluated on the new dataset. 

	% Evaluation (short)
	We conducted a user study to validate our assumptions (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption} and \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}) and to thereby verify the mined-and-modified dataset.
	Additionally, we evaluate the performance improvement on the towards model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} using the automatically generated dataset.
		
	% Contributions
	Our contributions are as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We combine and unify existing datasets~\citeolddataset
		\item We propose a approach to mine well readable methods
		\item We create a tool to decrease the readability of Java class files
		\item We propose a novel dataset generation approach and introduce a new readability classification dataset, namely the mined-and-modified dataset
%		\item We publish a re-implementation of the towards model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards}
		\item We evaluate our generation approach with a user study
		\item We evaluate our generation approach by comparing the model performance of the towards model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} trained with and without the mined-and-modified dataset	
	\end{itemize}
	
	% Implications
	The survey confirms both, the well-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption}) and the poorly-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}). Although our approach for creating a dataset works in principle, we are not able to address enough aspects of code readability with the proposed heuristics. Thus, our dataset probably only addresses a partial problem of code readability.
		
\section{Background and Related Work} \label{Background and Related Work}
	In the following subsections you find an overview of the background and related work on code readability and our approach to dataset creation.
	
\subsection{Code Readability} \label{Code Readability}
		
	% TODO: Add to introduction?
	% Importance	
	%	In the domain of software development, the importance of code readability cannot be emphasized enough. Alongside understandability, it forms the basis for effective collaboration, comprehension, and maintenance of software systems~\cite{posnett2011simpler, aggarwal2002integrated}.
	%	
	%	It is a critical aspect of software quality, significantly influencing the maintainability, reusability, portability, and reliability of the source code~\cite{alawad2019empirical, sedano2016code}. Poorly readable code increases the risk of introducing bugs~\cite{mannan2018towards, scalabrino2018comprehensive} and can lead to higher costs during subsequent software maintenance and development~\cite{johnson2019empirical}. On the other hand, readable code allows developers to identify and rectify bugs more easily~\cite{mi2023graph}.
	%	
	%	Recent studies indicate that developers spend nearly 58\% of their time reading and comprehending source code~\cite{buse2009learning, deimel1985uses, rugaber2000use, boehm2001defect, tashtoush2013impact, sedano2016code, xia2017measuring}.
	
	
	%	In the field of software development, a major focus continues to be on code readability and its profound impact on these aspects, as confirmed by numerous studies~\cite{deimel1985uses, rugaber2000use, boehm2001defect, aggarwal2002integrated, posnett2011simpler, buse2009learning, tashtoush2013impact, sedano2016code, xia2017measuring, mannan2018towards, scalabrino2018comprehensive, alawad2019empirical, johnson2019empirical, mi2023graph}.

	
%	Therefore, it is important to ensure a high readability of code. In order to archive this, we need to define and measure code readability.
	We start with an overview over definitions of code readability.
	
%	However, there are various definitions in the literature:
	
	% Readability in general
	%\citeauthor{klare1964measurement} defines readability in general as “the ease of understanding or comprehension due to the style of writing.” 

	% Readability in general
	%https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED490073.pdf
	%	 This definition focuses on writing
	%	style as separate from issues such as content, coherence, and organization. In a
	%	similar manner, Gretchen Hargis and her colleagues at IBM (1998) state that
	%	readability, the “ease of reading words and sentences,” is an attribute of clarity.
	%	The creator of the SMOG readability formula G. Harry McLaughlin (1969)
	%	defines readability as: “the degree to which a given class of people find certain
	%	reading matter compelling and comprehensible.” This definition stresses the
	%	interaction between the text and a class of readers of known characteristics such
	%	as reading skill, prior knowledge, and motivation.
	%	Edgar Dale and Jeanne Chall’s (1949) definition may be the most
	%	comprehensive: “The sum total (including all the interactions) of all those
	%	elements within a given piece of printed material that affect the success a group
	%	of readers have with it. The success is the extent to which they understand it,
	%	read it at an optimal speed, and find it interesting.” 
	%	\cite{dubay2004principles}
	
	% Definiton
	\citeauthor{buse2009learning} provides one of the first definitions: "We define readability as a human judgment of how easy a
	text is to understand."

	% Definition
	\citeauthor{tashtoush2013impact} combines numerous other aspects from various definitions. According to them code readability can be measured by looking at the following aspects~\cite{tashtoush2013impact}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ratio between lines of code and number of commented lines
		\item Writing to people not to computers
		\item Making a code locally understandable without searching for declarations and definitions
		\item Average number of right answers to a series of questions about a program in a given length of time
	\end{itemize}
	
	% Definition
	Recent definitions of code readability are shorter, trying to focus on the key aspects. \citeauthor{oliveira2020evaluating} defines readability as "what makes a program easier or harder to read and apprehend by developers"~\cite{oliveira2020evaluating}.
			
	% Definition
	Also \citeauthor{mi2021effectiveness} summarizes code readability as "a human judgment of how easy a piece of
	source code is to understand"~\cite{mi2021effectiveness}. This comes close to the definition of \citeauthor{buse2009learning}~\cite{buse2009learning}.
	
	% Related terms	
	There are various related terms to readability: Understandability, usability, reusability, complexity, and maintainability~\cite{tashtoush2013impact}. Among those especially complexity and understandability are closely related to readability.
	
	Readability is not the same as complexity. Complexity is an “essential” property of software that arises
	from system requirements, while readability is an “accidental” property that is not determined by the problem statement~\cite{buse2009learning, brooks1987no}.
	
	Readability is neither the same as understandability, as the key aspects of understandability are~\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive, martin2009clean, wilson2007beautiful, beck2007implementation}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Complexity
		\item Usage of design concepts
		\item Formatting
		\item Source code lexicon
		\item Visual aspects (e.g., syntax highlighting)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\citeauthor{posnett2011simpler} states that readability is the syntactic aspect of processing code, while understandability is the semantic aspect~\cite{posnett2011simpler}.
	
	Based on \citeauthor{posnett2011simpler}, \citeauthor{scalabrino2018comprehensive} writes about readability: "Readability measures the effort of the developer to access the information contained in the code, while understandability measures the complexity of such information"~\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive, posnett2011simpler}.
	
	%	Readability is a human judgment of how easy a program source code is to read and comprehend~\cite{buse2008metric, sedano2016code}. It is concerned with the syntactic aspects of code, such as the use of meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, and clear commenting.
	%	
	%	Understandability is the ability to grasp the meaning of a program source code and how it works~\cite{oliveira2020evaluating, posnett2011simpler}. It is concerned with the semantic aspects of code, such as the underlying logic and the use of design patterns.
	
	For example, a developer can find a piece of code readable but still difficult to understand. Recent research gives evidence that there is no correlation between understandability and readability~\cite{scalabrino2017automatically}.	
	
	
	% However, \citeauthor{scalabrino2018comprehensive} also states, that "code readability remains to be a very subjective concept".
		
	%	
	%	For now we stick with the definition of BUSE and WEIMER which also \citeauthor{mi2023graph} sticks with:
	%	Code readability is defined as a measure of how easily developers can read and understand
	%	the source code (Buse and Weimer 2010; Lee et al 2013)

	Comparing the definitions of code readability in literature we can see, that there are some common aspects in most definitions. These are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ease/complexity of understanding/comprehension/apprehension
		\item Human judgment/assessment
		\item Effort of the process of reading (differentiation to understandability)
	\end{itemize}
	Based on this, we come up with the following definition: 
%	\begin{definition}[Code readability]
%		Code readability is the human assessment of the effort required to read and understand code.
%	\end{definition}

	% TODO: Discuss with Lisa (and gordon?)
	\textit{Code readability is the human assessment of the effort required to read and understand code.}

	% TODO: Update citations
	In the last years, researchers have proposed several metrics and models for assessing code readability with an accuracy of up to 81.8~\%~\citeclassicmodels. In recent years, deep learning-based models are able to achieve an accuracy of to 88.0~\%~\citedeepmodels on available datasets. 
%	By using data augmentation the score can be improved even further to 87.3\%~\cite{mi2021effectiveness}.
%	However, these models do not capture what developers think of readability improvements~\cite{fakhoury2019improving}. This suggests that there is room for improvement in readability classification of source code.
	Examining these works more closely in the following, we delve into their intricacies.
	
%	% Importance
%	In software engineering, the terms readability, legibility, understandability, and comprehensibility have overlapping meanings. For example, Buse and Weimer [22] define “readability
%	as a human judgment of how easy a text is to understand”.
%	In a similar vein, Almeida et al. [23] affirm that “legibility is
%	fundamental to code maintenance; if source code is written
%	in a complex way, understanding it will require much more
%	effort”. In addition, Lin and Wu [24] state that ““Software
%	understandability” determines whether a system can be understood by other individuals easily, or whether artifacts of
%	one system can be easily understood by other individuals”.
%	Xia et al. [25] treat comprehension and understanding as
%	synonyms, expressing that “Program comprehension (aka.,
%	program understanding, or source code comprehension) is a
%	process where developers actively acquire knowledge about a
%	software system by exploring and searching software artifacts,
%	and reading relevant source code and/or documentation”.\cite{oliveira2020evaluating}
%	
%	% Importance
%	Software developers read code all the time. The very first step in each software evolution and
%	maintenance task is to carefully read and understand the code; this step needs to be done even
%	when the maintainer is the author of the code. Developers spend much time reading code, far more
%	than writing it from scratch [1]. Therefore, if code is readable, it is pretty easy to start changing it;
%	instead, modifying unreadable code is like assembling a piece of furniture with instructions written
%	in a foreign language the one does not speak: the task is not impossible, but difficult, and a few
%	screws still may remain unused.
%	Furthermore, incremental change [2, 3, 4], which is required to perform concept location, impact
%	analysis, and the corresponding change implementation/propagation, needs a prior code reading
%	step before it can take place. This is why “readable code” is a fundamental and highly desirable at
%	any stage during software maintenance and evolution.\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive}
%	
%	% Definition
%	Readability vs understandability
%	t et al. [9] compared the difference between readability and understandability to the difference
%	between syntactic and semantic analysis. Readability measures the effort of the developer to access
%	the information contained in the code, while understandability measures the complexity of such
%	information. We defined a set of textual features that still capture aspects of code related to the
%	difficulty of accessing the information contained in a snippet. For example, NOC estimates the
%	number of concepts implemented in a snippet. A snippet with a few concepts, potentially more
%	readable, can still be hard to understand if a few concepts are not easy to understand. In our opinion,
%	textual features, which do not take into account semantics, like the ones we defined, can be used to
%	measure readability
%	\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive}
%	
%	% Related terms
%	Definitions show clearly
%	that such quality attribute is related to some other attributes such as: understandability,
%	usability, reusability, complexity, or maintainability. 
%	Code readability is usually connected with comments and naming standards. While
%	those are two major factors that impact readability, there are also some other aspects to
%	consider.
%	One of the new concepts that appear in relation with software quality and readability
%	is the refactoring process. It means changing code structure externally without affecting
%	internal behavior to improve readability, flexibility, and enable easier modifications
%	[12-14]. Refactoring often aims to add new non functional objectives for code, without
%	affecting its main purpose by testing the code frequently.
%	In [15] the author defines “improving code readability” as the first advantage for
%	code refactoring. The survey briefly explains code refactoring techniques such as: field
%	encapsulation, type generalization, or methods renaming. Refactoring advantages
%	include: improving readability, maintainability, less complexity, and reusability.

	% New, check and extend (Bard)
	%	Code readability is a human judgment of how easy a program source code is to understand~\cite{buse2008metric}. It is a subjective concept that is influenced by a number of factors, including the complexity of the code, the usage of design concepts, the formatting of the code, the source code lexicon, and the visual aspects of the code~\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive}.
		

	
%	There are a number of different definitions of code readability in the literature. Some of these definitions are:
%	
%	"Code readability is the ease of understanding a program source code."~\cite{buse2008metric}
%	"Code readability is the ratio between lines of code and number of commented lines."~\cite{sedano2016code}
%	"Code readability is writing to people, not to computers."~\cite{oliveira2020evaluating}
%	"Code readability is making a code locally understandable without searching for declarations and definitions."~\cite{oliveira2020evaluating}
%	"Code readability is the average number of right answers to a series of questions about a program in a given length of time."~\cite{oliveira2020evaluating}
%	While these definitions vary, they all share the common theme of measuring how easy it is for humans to understand the code.
%			
	
	
	%	% Old:
	%	To improve readability classification, we need to capture what readability is. We define readability as a subjective impression of the difficulty of code while trying to understand it~\cite{posnett2011simpler, buse2009learning}. Readability of code is a perceived barrier that needs to be overcome before it is possible to work with the code. The more readable code is, the lower the barrier~\cite{posnett2011simpler}.
	%	To give an example for high vs low readability, consider the code of listing~\ref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils} from GitHub\curl{https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/Java/org/apache/cassandra/utils/HeapUtils.Java}{2023-25-07} and compare it to the code with the same functionality of listing~\ref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils-modified}. You will notice that the first piece of code is more readable than the second one.

	%	There is another related term: understandability. Readability is the syntactic aspect of processing code, while understandability is the semantic aspect~\cite{posnett2011simpler}.
	%	For example, a developer can find a piece of code readable but still difficult to understand. Recent research gives evidence that there is no correlation between understandability and readability~\cite{scalabrino2017automatically}.

\subsection{Conventional Calculation Approaches} \label{Classical Calculation Approaches}
	A first estimation for source code readability was the percentage of comment lines over total code lines~\cite{aggarwal2002integrated}. Then researchers proposed several more complex metrics and models for assessing code readability~\cite{buse2009learning, posnett2011simpler, dorn2012general, scalabrino2018comprehensive}.
	Those approaches used handcrafted features to calculate how readable a piece of code is. They were able to achieve up to 81.8~\% accuracy in classification~\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive}.
	
\subsection{Deep Learning Based Approaches} \label{Deep Learning Based Approaches}
	In recent years code readability classification is dominated by machine learning, especially deep learning approaches. As the quality of the models increased, so did their accuracy (see \autoref{tab:rel-acc-scores}).
	
	% Related work: ML - Inception (82.2\% to 84.2\% acc)
	IncepCRM was the first introduced deep learning model called for code readability classification. It automatically learns multi-scale features from source code with minimal manual intervention~\cite{mi2018inception}.
	
	% Related work: ML - CNN (83.8\% acc)
	In a follow up paper Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) were introduced to code readability classification in a model called DeepCRM. Other than previously, DeepCRM employs three ConvNets with identical architectures and was trained on differently preprocessed data~\cite{mi2018improving}.
		
	% Related work: ML - GANs (84.8\% acc)
	Another study proposes an approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed method involves encoding source codes into integer matrices with multiple granularities and utilizing an EGAN (Enhanced GAN)~\cite{sharma2020egan}. It was able to surpass the accuracy of previous readability classification models as shown in \autoref{tab:rel-acc-scores}.
	
	% Related work: ML - Towards (85.3\% acc)
	The limitation of previous deep learning-based code readability models was to focus primarily on structural features. This was addressed by proposing a method that extracts features from visual, semantic, and structural aspects of source code. Using a hybrid neural network composed of BERT, CNN, and BiLSTM, the model processes RGB matrices, token sequences, and character matrices to capture various features~\cite{mi2022towards}.
	
	% Related work: ML - Code pairs (83.5\% acc)
	Up to this point, code readability classification was considered mainly as a task that is applied to a single code snippet at once. A new approach was introduced that frames the problem as a ranking task. The proposed model employs siamese neural networks to rank code pairs based on their readability~\cite{mi2022rank}.

	% Related work: ML - AST + GNN (72.5\% three class, 88\% two class acc)
	All previous accuracy scores in two class classification were surpassed by the introduction of a graph-based representation method for code readability classification. The proposed method involves parsing source code into a graph with abstract syntax tree (AST), combining control and data flow edges, and converting node information into vectors. The model, comprising Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), DMoNPooling, and K-dimensional Graph Neural Networks (k-GNNs) layers, extracts syntactic and semantic features~\cite{mi2023graph}.

	You can find an overview over the accuracy scores for the models mentioned in \autoref{tab:rel-acc-scores}.

	Until now many deep learn architectures and components were introduced with the goal to surpass previous classification accuracy scores. Their common limitation is a dataset consisting of \numOriginal code snippets for training and evaluation.
	The main contribution of this work is not a model that outperforms a state of the art model but rather a new dataset (generation approach). For evaluation we opted for the \textit{Mi\_Towards} model (hereinafter referred to as towards model) from \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards}. We did not choose the best performing one, \textit{Mi\_Graph}, as its main contribution is to use the AST representation of the code, while our dataset generation approach includes features that are not represented in the AST~\cite{mi2023graph}.
			
\subsection{Data Augmentation} \label{Data Augmentation}

	% Related work: Existing data
	All the mentioned models were trained with (a part of) the data from Buse, Dorn and Scalabrino consisting of a total of 421 Java code snippets. The data was generated with surveys. They therefore asked developers several questions, including how well readable the proposed source code is~\cite{buse2009learning, dorn2012general, scalabrino2018comprehensive}. We will refer to this dataset as \textit{merged} dataset.
	
%	TODO
%	Prinzipiell schöne Übersicht von hier bis 2.5
%	Aber fehlt Einordnung: wie related das zu deinem Zeug? Z.B. be dem augmentation Paper kam meines Wissens ja raus, dass das die Modell-Ergebnisse ja tatsächlich verbessert.
%	Man könnte also z.B. schreiben: wir machen auch augmentation, weil das gut funktioniert, aber verfolgen einen Ansatz der ohne Domänenwissen auskommt.
	
	The problem that there is little data in the area of code readability classification for machine learning models has been recognized.
					
	% Related work: Data Augmentation - GAN (87.38\% acc)
	A recent paper addressed the challenge of acquiring a larger amount of labeled data using augmentation. The researchers proposed this to artificially expand the training set instead of the time-consuming and expensive process of obtaining labels manually. They employ domain-specific transformations, such as manipulating comments, indentations, and names of classes/methods/variables, and explore the use of Auxiliary Classifier GANs to generate synthetic data. They advance to a classification accuracy of 87.3~\%~\cite{mi2021effectiveness}.
	% Related work: Data Augmentation - GAN (68.0\% acc)
%	Due to a scarcity of labeled data, most prior research focused on binary classification. This was due to supposedly due to a scarcity of labeled data, most prior research focused on binary classification.
	Lately researchers successfully enhanced the data augmentation approach by incorporating domain-specific data transformation and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)~\cite{mi2022enhanced}.
	The results of both show, that more data has a significant impact on the reached classification accuracy. However, they artificially augment data based on the \numOriginal code snippets of the merged data set. Therewith their augmented data is based on the small dataset. The minded-and-modified dataset is not.
	%	, which further delimits its potential.
	
	% Related work: Data Generation - GitHub commits
	Recently researchers developed a methodology to identify readability-improving commits, creating a dataset of 122k commits from GitHub's revision history. This dataset was used to automatically identify and suggest readability-improving actions for code snippets. They trained a T5 model to emulate developers' actions in improving code readability, achieving a prediction accuracy between 21~\% and 28~\%. The empirical evaluation shows that 82-91~\% of the dataset commits aim to improve readability, and the model successfully mimics developers in 21~\% of cases~\cite{vitale2023using}. 
	This shows the potential of a large dataset. However, the approach dataset and model results are hardly comparable with previous studies due to the usage of commits instead of code snippets. We, on the other hand, keep to use code snippets.
		
	
\subsection{Diverse Perspectives} \label{Diverse Perspectives}

	There is also other important research in the field of readability classification that does not directly affect this work, but could have implications for future work.
	
	% Related work: Commit analysis - GitHub commits
	\citeauthor{fakhoury2019improving} showed based on readability improving commit analysis that previous models do not capture what developers think of readability improvements. They therefore analyzed 548 GitHub\curl{https://github.com/}{2023-07-25} commits manually. They suggest considering other metrics such as incoming method calls or method name fitting~\cite{fakhoury2019improving}.	
	
	% Related work: Data Augmentation
	\citeauthor{oliveira2020evaluating} conducted a systematic literature review of 54 relevant studies on code readability and legibility, examining how different factors impact comprehension. The authors analyze tasks and response variables used in studies comparing programming constructs, coding idioms, naming conventions, and formatting guidelines~\cite{oliveira2020evaluating}.
	
	% Related work: Manual (python)
	In a recent study participants demonstrated a consistent perception that Python code with more lines was deemed more comprehensible, irrespective of their level of experience. However, when it came to readability, variations were observed based on code size, with less experienced participants expressing a preference for longer code, while those with more experience favored shorter code. Both novices and experts agreed that long and complete-word identifiers enhanced readability and comprehensibility. Additionally, the inclusion of comments was found to positively impact comprehension, and a consensus emerged in favor of four indentation spaces~\cite{ribeiro2018attributes}.
	
	% Related work: Eclipse tool
	\citeauthor{choi2020metric} introduced an enhanced source code readability metric aimed at quantitatively measuring code readability in the software maintenance phase. The proposed metric achieves a substantial explanatory power of 75.7~\%. Additionally, the authors developed a tool named Instant R. Gauge, integrated with Eclipse IDE, to provide real-time readability feedback and track readability history, allowing developers to gradually improve their coding habits~\cite{choi2020metric}.
	
	% Related work: Relationships between features and readability
	\citeauthor{mi2023makes} aim to understand the causal relationship between code features and readability. To overcome potential spurious correlations, the authors propose a causal theory-based approach, utilizing the PC algorithm and additive noise models to construct a causal graph. Experimental results using human-annotated readability data reveal that the average number of comments positively impacts code readability, while the average number of assignments, identifiers, and periods has a negative impact~\cite{mi2023makes}.
	
	% Related work: Eye tracking
	\citeauthor{segedinac2024assessing} introduces a novel approach for code readability classification using eye-tracking data from 90 undergraduate students assessing Python code snippets~\cite{segedinac2024assessing}.
	
\subsection{Data Generation} \label{Data Generation}

	In addition to related work on models and datasets, there is also related work that uses some of the ideas that we employ in our proposed approach for data generation.
	
	% Related work: RDH
	\citeauthor{loriot2022styler} created a model that is able to fix Checkstyle\curl{https://checkstyle.org/}{2023-07-25} violations using Deep Learning. They inserted formatting violations based on a project specific format checker ruleset into code in a first step. They then used a LSTM neural network that learned how to undo those injections. Their approach is working on abstract token sequences. Their data is generated in a self-supervised manner~\cite{loriot2022styler}. A similar idea has been explored by \citeauthor{yasunaga2020graph}~\cite{yasunaga2020graph}. We will use the idea of intentional degradation of code for data generation.
	
	% Related work: Public code mining
	Another concept we will employ is from \citeauthor{allamanis2016convolutional}. They cloned the top open source Java projects on GitHub\curl{https://github.com/}{2023-07-25} for training a Deep Learning model. Those top projects were selected by taking the sum of the z-scores of the number of watchers and forks of each project. The projects have thousands of forks and stars and are widely used among software developers and thus the authors assumed the code within to be of good quality~\cite{allamanis2016convolutional}. We will also use fork and star counts as criteria for well readable code (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption}).
		
\section{Mined and Modified Code for Dataset Generation} \label{Mined and Modified Code for Dataset Generation}
	In the following subsections we will describe our approach.
		
\subsection{Work on Existing Datasets} \label{Work on Existing Datasets}
%	Later we will compare the mined-and-modified dataset and its generation approach against existing datasets for readability classification.

	Most of the related work (see \Cref{Background and Related Work}) uses a combination of the data of \citeauthor{buse2009learning}, \citeauthor{dorn2012general} and \citeauthor{scalabrino2018comprehensive}. The raw data from their surveys can be downloaded \curl{https://dibt.unimol.it/report/readability/}{2024-02-18}, but their data is not uniformly formatted, including ratings that are not Java code snippets, as well as the individual ratings rather than the mean of the ratings used for training machine learning models. Other than our mined-and-modified code snippets theirs do not all have the scope of a method, but instead consist of a few lines of code.
	
	We converted and combined the three datasets into one: code-readability-merged. In recent years, Huggingface\curl{https://huggingface.co/}{2024-02-18} established as the pioneer in making models and datasets available. Therefore we decided to publish the merged dataset on Huggingface\curl{https://huggingface.co/datasets/se2p/code-readability-merged}{2024-02-18}.
	
	We refer to this dataset as the \textit{merged} one.
	
\subsection{Classification Considerations} \label{Classification Considerations}
	
	When classifying the readability of code, the state of the art is to perform a binary classification into well readable and poorly readable code~\cite{mi2018inception, mi2018improving, sharma2020egan, mi2022towards, mi2022rank}. 
	
% TODO
%	Ich würde den Absatz hierzu etwas relativieren.
%	Wenn ich das richtig im Kopf habe, dann geben die meisten Classifier Modelle ja einen kontinuierlichen Wert zwischen 0 und 1 aus, was im Prinzip genau dem entspricht, was du forderst.
%	Im Wesentlichen wird nur ein Knoten dahinter geschaltet, der abhängig vom Wert vorher dann eine Gruppe selektiert (</>=0.5).
%	Das, was du ansprichst, zielt ja eher darauf ab, dass für die Evaluierung die binäre Klassifizierung verwendet wird.
%	Und der Grund dafür ist sicherlich, dass es einfacher ist, das dazustellen, und dass man bessere Ergebnisse bekommt (das wissen denk ich auch alle, dafür brauchts nicht probably eigene research) :-) 
%	Ich würd also  nur schreiben:
%	- die Daten werden üblicherweise auf ner 5-point Likert scale erhoben
%	- am Schluss wird als binäre Klassifizierung evaluiert
%	- die Frage ist, wie dazwischen (beim Modelltraining) mit den Daten umgegangen wird. Mi machen das folgendermaßen... 
	
	However, code readability classification is not a binary classification task per se. \citeauthor{mi2023graph} introduced a third, neutral class to address this problem~\cite{mi2023graph}. 
	When rating code snippets, a Likert scale~\cite{likert1932technique} from 1 (very unreadable) to 5 (very readable) was used~\citeolddataset. 
	While the amount of classes varies, one can encode the data internally as a single-value representation between 0 and 1 where a higher value means higher readability. The output of the model is well readable if the value after the last layer is above 0.5 and poorly readable otherwise.
	
	Our evaluation model is the towards model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} and uses the single-value representation. We want to show how they transformed the rating scores into a binary classification problem. First, the mean values of all scores are calculated. In a second step, the snippets are ranked according to their mean score. Then, the top 25~\% of the data is labeled as well readable (1.0) and the bottom 25~\% is labeled as poorly readable (0.0). The 50~\% of the data in between is not used at all~\cite{mi2022towards}.
	
	While this transformation is fine in principle, especially with the argument that the data in the middle is neither well readable nor poorly readable, it has drawbacks that only 50~\% of the available data is used for model training and evaluation:
	
	First, the available data is further reduced from 421 to 210 Java code snippets. Note that a bottleneck in readability classification is the small amount of available data. So this is a significant loss.
	
	Secondly, evaluation is performed with only those 210 snippets as well. Thus, the model was only evaluated on 50~\% of the available data. We suspect that this might be a thread to validity. It could be that the performance of the model is remarkably lower when the evaluation is performed with random, unseen data that also contains moderately readable code snippets.
	
	However, we will both continue to use the binary classification approach as well as to the towards model~\cite{mi2022towards} to make our results comparable to theirs.
	
\subsection{Dataset Generation Approach} \label{Dataset Generation Approach}
	In contrast to previous datasets for readability classification, our dataset is generated using an automated approach. The aim is to mine and modify code from GitHub to obtain both well readable and poorly readable methods. This approach is novel to the best of our knowledge. You can find a visualization in \autoref{fig:dataset_generation}.
	
	% TODO: Add figures as pdf or high quality
	\begin{figure}[tb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/dataset_generation.png}
		\caption{The used dataset generation approach.} % TODO: Replace baldy with poorly
		\label{fig:dataset_generation}
	\end{figure}
	
	While we refer to the merged data set (\Cref{Work on Existing Datasets}) as the merged data set, the data set generated by our approach is referred to as the mined-and-modified dataset.
	
	Since we ultimately extract methods from code, code snippets and methods are synonyms for our mine-and-modify approach. This is not the case with the merged data set, as there a code snippet is not necessarily an entire method.
	
	The approach is divided into four parts. The first three steps are used to mine well readable Java code. In a final step, we will modify the well readable code to achieve our second goal, namely poorly readable source code.
	
	We start by querying the GitHub REST API\curl{https://docs.github.com/en/rest}{2024-02-15} for repositories that use checkstyle (query string: "checkstyle filename:pom.xml"). The repository informations (including the URL) are stored together with the main branches.
	We remove all repositories that do not fulfill these criteria:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The repository is not a fork of another repository
		\item The repository is not archived
		\item The repository is not disabled
		\item The repository language is Java
		\item The repository has at least 20 stars
		\item The repository has at least 20 forks
	\end{itemize}
	
	% TODO: Why miteinbauen oder eher nicht?
	The remaining ones are sorted by their star and fork count (equally weighted). The 100 best are cloned and their main branch is checked out.
	
	In a third step we run checkstyle\curl{https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/}{2024-02-15} against the projects own checkstyle configuration to get all Java class files, that pass the own checkstyle test. A tool from Maximilian Jungwirth\curl{https://github.com/sphrilix}{TODO} was used for this purpose. From the Java classes that passed this filter we extract all methods that have a comment of any kind at the beginning of the method. This results in \numOriginal methods which we assume to be well readable.
	
	The fourth and final step is to generate poorly readable code from the well readable one. Therefore we use the proposed Readability Decreasing Heuristics (see \Cref{Readability Decreasing Heursitcs}). Afterwards we again extract all methods with a comment at the beginning of the method.
	Initially we planned to not require comments for the poorly readable dataset part. However, it turns out that in this case all well readable methods have a comment while most of the poorly readable do not have one. This lead to shortcut learning, whether a method has a comment or not instead of learning to distinguishing the methods by all other criteria as well.
	After removing code snippets that are identical for the original and the variant with reduced readability (see \Cref{Readability Decreasing Heursitcs}) and balancing the data set using random sampling, the result is a data set consisting of \numSamples code snippets.
	
\subsection{Readability Decreasing Heuristics} \label{Readability Decreasing Heursitcs}
	In this section we explain how we achieved to decrease the readability of code using Readability Decreasing Heuristics (RDH).
	The RDH are a set of code manipulation heuristics that are applied to Java files. One part is performed on the abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the Java files using the spoon library\curl{https://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/}{2024-15-02}~\cite{pawlak2016spoon}. Another part is executed when pretty-printing the AST back into Java files. This part cannot be displayed in the AST and is therefore executed at source code level immediately after the reverse transformation.
	%	From now on, we will use the abbreviation \textit{RDH} or \textit{RDH tool} when referring to the entire program. If a specific manipulation or a configuration of the RDH tool is meant, we will use \textit{[name] rdh} or \textit{[name]} instead.
	
	The RDH tool initially converts the Java code of any well readable Java class file into an AST. In the end the AST is parsed back to Java code using an pretty printer. If nothing else is done, this results in the \texttt{none}. Note that the code produced by the tool in this way will be slightly different from the original input code, as the styling and formatting of the original code will be overwritten by the default formatting of the Java Pretty Printer of the spoon library\curl{https://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/}{2024-15-02}~\cite{pawlak2016spoon}.
	
	%	Renaming is done while the code is in its AST representation to ensure that the declarations and usages of variables (\texttt{renameVariable}), fields (\texttt{renameField}) and methods (\texttt{renameMethod}) are all renamed to the same new identifier.
	
	% What is available
	Various modifications can be made between the two steps and during pretty-printing (see \autoref{tab:rdhs}).
	These modifications are performed on the AST representation of the code to ensure that the functionality stays the same (see \autoref{tab:ast-rdhs}).

	By default the new identifiers for the rename modifications (\texttt{renameVariable}, \texttt{renameField} and \texttt{renameMethod}) are generated in an iterating manner. For each class file we start with \textit{v0} for variables, \textit{f0} for fields and \textit{m0}. We increase the index of each (0 at the beginning) by 1 whenever a name is used.
	We also added a mode that uses Code2Vec~\cite{alon2019code2vec} for the generation of identifiers for \texttt{renameMethod} instead. With that we can predict more realistic method names. Code2Vec generates multiple method name predictions at once. By picking not the best one but instead the one with the longest name we aim to decrease readability while choosing realistic method names.

	The removal of spaces is not supported, as this would cause keywords or identifiers to merge.
	Tab \textit{indentation} refers to the process of adding a tab ($\backslash t$) while \textit{outdentation} refers to the opposite, namely removing a tab ($\backslash t$). 
%	For example, if the current tab count is 1 ($\backslash t \langle CODE \rangle$) (see \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils}, Line 7) a tab indentation results in a tab count of 2 ($\backslash t \backslash t \langle CODE \rangle $) (see \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils}, Line 8) and then a tab outdentation results in a tab count of 1 again ($ \backslash t \langle CODE \rangle$) (see \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils}, Line 9).
	For example:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The current tab count is 1 ($\backslash t \langle CODE \rangle$) (see \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils} Line 7)
		\item In the next line, we perform a tab indentation
		\item The current tab count is now 2 ($\backslash t \backslash t \langle CODE \rangle $) (see \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils}, Line 8)
		\item In the next line, we perform a tab outdentation
		\item The current tab count is now 1 ($\backslash t \langle CODE \rangle $) (see \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils}, Line 9)
	\end{enumerate}
	
%	\begin{sloppypar}
%	These include adding spaces (\texttt{space}), replacing spaces with newlines (\texttt{spaceInsteadOfNewline}), adding or removing newlines (\texttt{newline}), replacing newlines with spaces (\texttt{newLineInsteadOfSpace}), and changing the indentation of code in term of tabs (\texttt{incTab}, \texttt{decTab}, \texttt{incTabInsteadOfDecTab}, \texttt{decTabInsteadOfIncTab}).
%	\end{sloppypar}

	% What did we exclude and why
	For the final dataset we excluded some of the RDHs as we can see in \autoref{tab:rdhs}.
	We excluded \texttt{inlineMethod} as it increased the length of methods drastically and made the methods too long.
	While \texttt{starImport} might have an impact on the readability of class files it has none on methods as in Java the import statement are not within the methods in Java. As we finally extract methods for our dataset, \texttt{starImport} has no impact.
	%	We did not include \texttt{partiallyEvaluate} as it might be that this modification increases readability instead of decreasing it.
	We chose to not include \texttt{add0}, \texttt{insertBraces}, \texttt{inlineField} and \texttt{partiallyEvaluate} for the reason of a limited survey capacity.
	For the same reason, we did not investigate the usage of Code2Vec for \texttt{renameMethod} either.

	%	\end{figure}
	
	% Cofig: Array vs Single
	The RDH tool works with a configuration file in which one can specify a probability for each heuristic that can be applied.
	For heuristics of configuration type \textit{Array} (\texttt{newline}, \texttt{incTab}, \texttt{decTab} and \texttt{space}), a array of probabilities must be defined for the respective number of replacements. The probabilities of the array must sum up to 1.
	For heuristics of configuration type \textit{Single} (others) a single probability must be defined (see \autoref{tab:rdhs}).
	For example, \texttt{spaceInsteadOfNewline} can be configured with $0.05$ meaning that each space is replaced with a newline ($\backslash n$) with a probability of 5~\%.
	\texttt{space} can be configured with $[0.0, 0.7, 0.2, 0.1]$ meaning that each space is replaced with
	\begin{itemize}
		\item no space with a probability of 0~\%
		\item a single space with a probability of 70~\% (no change)
		\item two spaces with a probability of 20~\%
		\item three spaces with a probability of 10~\% 
	\end{itemize}
		
	% Config: 
	We have chosen the probabilities so that the generated code snippets are still realistic in the sense that they could also be written by humans. You can find the configurations in \autoref{tab:rdh_configurations} and an exemplary file for \texttt{none} in appendix \ref{appendix:rdh-config-file}.

	% Method extraction
	The individual methods are then extracted from the class files. As mentioned (see \Cref{Dataset Generation Approach}), we require a method comment for all methods. We therefore use \texttt{removeComment} after completing the method extraction.
	
\subsection{Construction of Questionnaires} \label{Construction of Questionnaires}
	We evaluated the generated data set and the new approach with a survey. To do this, we had to carefully select suitable code snippets from the dataset. An overview of the approach can be found in \autoref{fig:survey_pipeline}.

	\begin{figure}[tb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/survey_pipeline.png}
		\caption{Steps performed to craft questionnaires from the mined-and-modified dataset.}
		\label{fig:survey_pipeline}
	\end{figure}
		
	The first step was to find realistic configurations for the RDH tool. After an initial data set with the heuristics was created, a pilot study was conducted. Subsequently, heuristics with a low rating were adjusted to be weaker according to the results of the pilot survey. The result consisted of 9 different RDHs, which can be found in \autoref{tab:rdh_configurations}. Together with the original methods this resulted in 10 different configurations.
	

	
	
	The configurations are based on probabilities for different heuristics. A heuristic is applied with the specified probability to each occurrence of the object to which it refers. For example, when \texttt{removeComment} is applied with a probability of 10~\% to each comment that occurs within the code snippet. The exact scope of changes is therefore uncertain. It can happen (especially with short methods such as getters and setters) that a method is not changed at all. For example, if a method only has a single comment and we use \texttt{removeComment}, the probability that the method will not be changed is 90~\%.
	
	In a second step, we applied stratified sampling~\cite{thompson2012sampling} to distinguish between very simple methods such as getter and setter and more complex methods. In order to be able to compare the original methods with their modified variants, we only carried out the random sampling for the original methods and compared the rdh methods with these in a later step.
	
	Thus, we first calculated features for the original code snippets. This was done using the tool of \citeauthor{scalabrino2018comprehensive}~\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive}. A 110-dimensional feature vector was calculated for each original code snippet. Next we computed the cosine similarity metrix between all feature vectors using scikit\curl{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html}{2024-02-20}. 
	Finally, using the fastcluster implementation~\cite{mullner2013fastcluster} of Ward's hierarchical clustering we were able to cluster the methods into an arbitrary amount of clusters.	
		
	By comparing the merge distances in each step (see \autoref{fig:strata_merge_distances}), we found that a cluster size of 4 makes the most sense: the merge distance of 5 to 4 is small, so we should still perform this merge, but the merge distance of 4 to 3 is large, so it is better not to perform this merge. Also, 4 is the size with the last possibility for a small merge distance. Each of the clusters is one stratum of our stratified sampling. We manually assigned a name to each of the 4 strata (see \autoref{tab:strata_info}).
	
	% TODO: Continue here

%			Stratum 3 & Medium complex methods \\
%			\bottomrule
%		\end{tabular}
%	\end{table}
		
	In a third step, we crafted the questionnaires from the strata. We decided to provide all 10 previously mentioned configurations for each original method, as we want to compare the original methods with their rdh variants. We have a survey capacity of 400 code snippets (see \Cref{Prolific Survey}). Therefore, the capacity for each rdh variant is $400/10 = 40$ code snippets. We start by selecting 40 original code snippets and then add all their rdh variants.
	We opted for a random sample within the strata. However, we distributed the 40 snippets across the strata as shown in Table~\ref{tab:strata_info}.

			\textbf{Total} & \textbf{} & \textbf{100 \%} & \textbf{40} \\

		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	This decision was made due to the relatively high frequency of methods that do not differ from their original methods (see \autoref{fig:sampling_not_different_overall}). Another reason for this decision is that particularly simple methods are rather uninteresting for the classification of readability, as they are often generated (e.g. by IDEs) and usually follow a straightforward pattern.

		\caption{Frequency of the case that a rdh-method is not different from its original method.} 
		\label{fig:sampling_not_different_overall}
	\end{figure}
		
	After selecting the 40 original methods, we next selected all $9*40$ rdh variants that belong to the original methods. This was mostly done automatically based on the names of the original methods and the names of the rdh variant methods. However, if the method was renamed at an earlier stage due to the method renaming heuristic, the new method did no longer match the original method, in which case we had to match them manually.
		
	Once we collected all 400 methods, we distributed them across the 20 questionnaires, each with 20 methods. In order not to manipulate the raters, we decided that a variant of each method could only appear once in each questionnaire. For example, if the original method is in questionnaire 1, the removeComment variant (or another variant of the same method) must not be included in the same questionnaire.
		
	For this purpose, we created four permutation matrices with 10 snippets each. The number 10 was chosen because it is possible to distribute 10 snippets, each with 10 variants, across at least 10 survey questionnaires without violating our condition. By combining two 10-permutation matrices, we were able to create 10 survey questionnaires with 20 code snippets each. An implication of this approach is that each questionnaire contains each variant kind exactly twice. By doing this twice, we obtain the desired distribution of 20 questionnaires with 20 methods each. Our condition applies: There is only one variant of the same method in each questionnaire.
		
	Finally, the methods of each questionnaire were randomly shuffled within itself. This was done to minimize the impact of the position of a snippet or variant within a survey on the rating.

% TODO: Explain how in the final dataset the labeles are assigned
%	Each snippet of the well readable code (original) is labeled with the mean value of all ratings of the original variant across all survey results. Similarly, we label the all7 code snippets with their mean value. Note that in the binary classification with the underlying towards model, this results in the original methods being labeled well readable and the all7 rdh poorly readable.	
	
%	% We will conclude a user study to evaluate the newly generated data for readability classifier models.
%	The goal of the user study is to answer the following key questions:
%	
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Does the well-readable-assumption (assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption}) hold?
%		\item Does the poorly-readable-assumption (assumption \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}) hold?
%	\end{enumerate}
%	
%	We will achieve this by showing programmers code snippets that were generated with the presented approach. Therefore, human annotators give each code snippet a rating of its readability. The annotators are selected by Prolific\curl{https://www.prolific.com/}{2023-09-30}. Particular attention is paid to a high proportion of people from industry. The readability rating is based on a five-point Likert scale~\cite{likert1932technique} ranging from one (i.e., very 
%) to five (i.e., very readable). We apply the same rating as done previously~\cite{buse2009learning, dorn2012general, scalabrino2018comprehensive}, but, other than before, we will not use the rating for labeling the training data. Instead, we will only use the ratings to validate a few randomly selected code snippets out of many that are automatically labeled.
%	
%	\subsubsection{Comparing models}\label{compare-models}
%	Besides the user study we will evaluate our suggestions by comparing machine learning models against each other.
%	The comparisons are based on common metrics such as accuracy, F1-score and MCC~\cite{chicco2020advantages}. One can distinguish further between the following variants of comparing models:
%	
%	In one variant we compare models that have the same architecture (same layers, same weight initialization, same components, etc.) while they differ in the data they are trained on. For example, we can train a model with the merged and mined-and-modified datasets, separately and combined. If done for multiple model architectures we can evaluate how the differences in training data influence the model performance. 
%	
%	Another variant would be to compare models with different architecture but the same training data. In this way, we can evaluate newly introduced components by measuring and comparing the performance of such models.
%	
%	A third comparison variant is created by combining the first two. Both of them lead to many options in what to compare, especially if only small changes to training data or model architecture are done. To find out, if our suggestions lead to a better model overall, we will compare our newly created model with all changes at once to the state-of-the-art model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards}.
%	
%	\subsubsection{Research questions}\label{research-questions}
%	We come up with the following research questions:
%	
%	%	\begin{resq}What is the quality of our new approach for data generation?\end{resq} \label{RQ1}
%	%	Until now, the data for readability classification was generated manually. Therefore, human annotators ranked code snippets by their readability level based on a five-point Likert scale~\cite{likert1932technique} ranging from one (i.e., very unreadable) to five (i.e., very readable)~\cite{buse2009learning, dorn2012general, scalabrino2018comprehensive}. Our new data will be generated in an automatic approach, where no manual labeling of code is necessary. We want to compare the quality of this data to the data used for previous models.
%	
%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(mined-well)} Can automatically selected code be assumed to be well readable?\end{resq} \label{mined-well}
%	In our new approach for generating training data, we assume that the code from repositories is readable under certain conditions (assumption~\ref{well-readable-assumption}). We want to check whether that holds. To answer this question we will use the results of the user study (\autoref{user-study}).
%	
%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(modify-poor)} Can poorly readable code be generated from well readable code?\end{resq} \label{modify-poor}
%	It is not sufficient to have only well readable code for training a classifier. We also need poorly readable code. Therefore, we will try to generate such code from the well readable code. We will investigate whether this is possible in principle, and we will propose an automated approach for archiving this: Readability Decreasing Heuristics.
%	
%	As the name already suggests, the applied transformations on the source code are only heuristics. To answer, whether the generated code is poorly readable (assumption~\ref{poorly-readable-assumption}) we wildy (\autoref{user-study}).
%	
%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(best-heuristics)} Which heuristics are best to generate poorly readable code from well readable code?\end{resq} \label{best-heuristic}
%	We want to compare the modifications of the proposed heuristics for generating poorly readable code to each other. Therefore we will train the same classifier model with poorly readable code generated by different Readability Decreasing Heuristics. We will then evaluate the model variations against each other (\autoref{compare-models}) to answer the research question.
%	
%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(new-data)} To what extent can the new data improve existing readability models?\end{resq} \label{new-data}
%	It was shown that Deep Learning models get better the more training data is available~\cite{hestness2017deep}. This holds under the assumption that the quality of the data is the same or at least similar. We want to check if the quality of our new data is sufficient for improving the ier of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards}. Therefore we will train their proposed model with and without the new data and then evaluate the models against each other (\autoref{compare-models}).
%	
%	% Next RQ on new page
%	\pagebreak
%	
%	%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(model-modifications)} Optional: How can existing Deep Learning approaches be further improved?\end{resq} \label{model-modifications}
%	%	In recent years it was shown that Deep Learning models can be further improved by modifying the structure of the architecture or by introducing new components, parts or layers to existing architectures. We suggest two improvements for the model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards}: Embedding spaces and tabs as semantic tokens and adding a method name fitting component. We will evaluate the proposed improvements as described earlier~\ref{suggestions}.
%	
%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(embedding-spaces)} Optional: To what extend does the embedding of spaces and tabs in semantic code representations improve readability classification?\end{resq} \label{embedding-spaces}
%	The state-of-the-art model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} does consider spaces and tabs only in its visual component. We want to investigate if it can improve the quality of a Deep Learning based model if spaces and tabs are encoded as semantic tokens. We also want to investigate if this makes the visual component superfluous. We will evaluate the proposed improvement as described earlier (\autoref{compare-models}).
%	
%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(name-classifier)} Optional: To what extend does the usage of a method name classifier improve readability classification?\end{resq} \label{name-classifier}
%	Correct naming of identifiers is crucial for ensuring readability of software programs. It is of outstanding importance for readability of code that the name of methods fit the method bodies~\cite{liu2019learning}. We want to introduce a new component to the model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} that is built similar to Code2Vec~\cite{alon2019code2vec}. We want to investigate if the newly introduced component improves the quality of the resulting model. We will evaluate the proposed improvement as previously described (\autoref{compare-models}).
	
\subsection{Readability Classification Model} \label{Readability Classification Model}

	Next we investigate whether it is possible to score a higher accuracy as the towards model in classifying code readability with the mined-and-modified dataset.
	
	Therefore we created our own implementation of the towards model~\cite{mi2022towards} of \citeauthor{mi2022towards} using Keras\curl{https://keras.io/about/}{2024-02-20}. The model consists of three layers. A code representation layer, a feature extraction layer and a code readability classification layer. You can find an overview of the model architecture in \autoref{fig:model_pipeline}.
	
	\begin{figure}[tb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/model_pipline.png}
		\caption{The architecture of the towards model~\cite{mi2022towards} of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}.}
		\label{fig:model_pipeline}
	\end{figure}
	
	% Architecture
	The input for the model is a labeled dataset consisting of code snippets and whether they are badly or well readable. In the code representation layer three different code representations are generated from each code snippet: A visual, a semantic and a structural representation. 
	
	% Architecture: Visual embedding
	For the visual representation the syntax of the code is highlighted. Therefore \citeauthor{mi2022towards} assigned each type of syntactic element a color (see \autoref{tab:model-colors}). Instead of highlighting the words in the respective color, as done by an IDE, the words are replaced by color blocks instead (see \autoref{fig:visual_encoding}). \citeauthor{mi2022towards} used Eclipse\curl{https://www.eclipse.org/}{2024-03-02} to highlight the code snippets and then took screenshots to obtain a RGB Matrix~\cite{mi2022towards}.

	%	TODO: The color definitions do not match. Bug in our tool!
	
	% Architecture: Segment embedding
	For the semantic representation we split the code into tokens (e.g., keywords and operators) and use BERT~\cite{devlin2018bert} to embed each token as a vector~\cite{mi2022towards}.
	
	% Architecture: Structural embedding
	For the structural representation we split the code into characters and convert each into its corresponding ASCII value to obtain a ASCII matrix~\cite{mi2022towards}.
	
	% Architecture: Feature extraction (CNNs)
	The model itself takes the three representations as input. We perform feature extraction on the RGB matrix and the ASCII matrix using a CNN for each. Each of the CNNs consists of multiple convolution and max pooling layers and a single flatten layer~\cite{mi2022towards}. 
	
	% Architecture: Feature extraction BiLSTM
	On the token embedding the model performs feature extraction using a BERT embedding layer, convolution layers, a max pooling layer and a BiLSTM~\cite{mi2022towards}.
	
	% Architecture: Classification
	After extracting the feature from the three individual representations the output is merged and used as a input for the final step: code readability classification. In this step the model consists of multiple fully-connected layers and a dropout layer. The output is a single value, namely the readability score. If the score is above a certain limit, we classify the input as well readable, otherwise it is poorly readable~\cite{mi2022towards}.	
	
	% Different: Model
	We implemented this model as described by \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards} with a few adjustments:
	In contrast to the publicly available code of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}\curl{https://github.com/swy0601/Readability-Features}{2024-02-20}, our model includes (batch) encoders required for the model to be trained on new data and to perform the prediction task for new code snippets. In addition, our model supports fine-tuning by freezing certain layers as well as storing intermediate results, such as the encoded dataset. During evaluation, the model returns the evaluation statistics in form of a JSON file.
	
	% Different: Image encoding
	A larger adjustment was made when it comes to image encoding. To automate the generation of visual encodings we propose a different approach leading to a similar result. You can find an overview of our approach in \autoref{fig:visual_encoding_pipline}.
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/visual_encoding_pipline.png}
		\caption{The steps to automatically, visually encode code.}
		\label{fig:visual_encoding_pipline}
	\end{figure}
	
	In a first step we use Imgkit\curl{https://pypi.org/project/imgkit/}{2024-03-02} to convert the code to HTML. Thereby, a HTML class is assigned to each type of syntactic element. Next, we apply syntax highlighting using a CSS style sheet (see Appendix \ref{appendix:model-visual-colors}). In a third step we use pygments\curl{https://pygments.org/}{2024-03-02} to convert the HTML with the applied CSS to an image. We use pillow\curl{https://pypi.org/project/pillow/}{2024-03-02} to remove blur and adjust the padding of the image. Finally, the image is loaded using opencv-python\curl{https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/}{2024-03-02} which allows us to convert the image to an RGB tensor that is suitable as a model input.	
	
	% Problems
	During implementation, we encountered the following potential problem with the model:
	The token length for the BERT encoding (BERT-base-cased\curl{https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-cased}{2024-02-20}) used in the model is 100. What implications does this have? To answer this question, we first take a look at what a token comprises. In addition to special tokens that mark the beginning \textit{[CLS]} and the end \textit{[SEP]} of the input, each word represent a token. Furthermore, each special character (such as a slash~(\textbf{/}), parentheses~(\textbf{(},~\textbf{)},~\textbf{\{},~\textbf{\}}), a comma~(\textbf{,}), a semicolon~(\textbf{;}), arithmetic signs~(\textbf{=},~\textbf{<},~\textbf{>}) and many more) is also represented by its own token. Java identifiers are split into several tokens according to the convention of upper and lower case. If a identifier is not present in the model's vocabulary, the tokenizer splits it further into sub-identifiers or characters that are in the vocabulary. 
	For example in \autoref{lst:print-greeting}, Line 6, the word "int" is split into the tokens "in" and "t" as "int" is not part of the vocabulary of BERT-base-cased.

	\begin{listing}[tb]
		\begin{minted}[linenos, frame=lines, framesep=2mm]{Java}

			System . out . print ln ( " Number is positive " ) ;
			} else if ( number < 0 ) {
			System . out . print ln ( " Number is negative " ) ;
			} else {
			System . out . print [SEP]
		\end{minted}
		\caption{A Java method that was encoded and decoded using Bert-base-cased with a limit of 100. Space characters separate the tokens. Newlines are preserved for readability.}
		\label{lst:print-greeting}
	\end{listing}
	
	Consider the method from \autoref{lst:cassandra-src-Java-org-apache-cassandra-utils}. With a token limit of 100, the last encoded token is the last closing parenthesis in line 9. Everything from line 10 onwards is not encoded, which means that the information is lost for the semantic part of the model. To put it in other words: The model of \citeauthor{mi2022towards} only considers the first few lines of code snippets in its semantic component.
	
	The visual and structural encoders have similar limitations, but to a much smaller extent. The structural encoder encodes the first 50 lines of each code snippet and the visual encoder encodes the first 43 lines. While the constraints for these two encoders seem to be long enough to fully capture most code snippets, the semantic encoder seems to be too limited to do so.

	Although we want to note these limitations, we will keep them to allow a fair comparison of the datasets.

\section{Evaluation} \label{Evaluation}
	We tested the mined-and-modified dataset in two ways. On the one hand, we conducted a user study. On the other hand, we evaluated the impact of using the dataset for the towards model. In detail, we answer the following questions with both experiments:
	
	% TODO: Reorder assumptions and questions?
	
	% User study
	We are conducting a user study to determine the quality of the new data set. In detail the aim of the user study is to answer the following key questions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Does the well-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption}) hold?
		\item Does the poorly-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}) hold?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	% Assumptions
	Our assumptions are as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}[label={Assumption \arabic*},ref={\arabic*},leftmargin=*]
		\item \label{well-readable-assumption} \textbf{(well-readable-assumption)} The selected repositories contain mostly well readable code.
		\item \label{poorly-readable-assumption} \textbf{(poorly-readable-assumption)} After applying Readability Decreasing Heuristics, the code is poorly readable.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	% RQs
	Therefore, we come up with the following research questions:
	
	\begin{resq} \textbf{(mined-well)} Can automatically mined code be assumed to be well readable?\end{resq} \label{mined-well}
	In our new approach for generating training data, we assume that the code from repositories is well readable under certain conditions (Assumption~\ref{well-readable-assumption}). We want to check whether that holds. To answer this question we will use the results of the user study.
	
	\begin{resq} \textbf{(modify-poor)} Can poorly readable code be generated from well readable code?\end{resq} \label{modify-poor}
	It is not sufficient to have only well readable code for training a classifier. We also need poorly readable code. Therefore, we will try to generate such code from the well readable code. We will investigate whether this is possible in principle, and
	whether the proposed RDH tool (see \autoref{Readability Decreasing Heursitcs}) is able to achieve this.
	
	As the name already suggests, the applied transformations on the source code are only heuristics. To answer, whether the generated code is poorly readable (Assumption~\ref{poorly-readable-assumption}) we will utilize the results of the user study.
	
	%	\begin{resq} \textbf{(best-heuristics)} Which heuristics are best to generate poorly readable code from well readable code?\end{resq} \label{best-heuristic}
	%	We want to compare the modifications of the proposed heuristics for generating poorly readable code to each other. Therefore we will use the results of the user study (\autoref{user-study}).
	
	\begin{resq} \textbf{(new-data)} To what extent can the new data improve existing code readability classification models?\end{resq} \label{new-data}
	It was shown that Deep Learning models get better the more training data is available~\cite{hestness2017deep}. This holds under the assumption that the quality of the data is the same or at least similar. We want to check if the quality of our new data is sufficient for improving the deep learning-based readability classifier of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards}. Therefore we will train their proposed model with combinations of the merged and the mined-and-modified dataset and compare the evaluation statistics.

\subsection{Survey} \label{Survey}
	The results of our survey are divided into two parts: The results of the pilot survey (see \Cref{Pilot Survey}), which were used to improve the main survey pre-launch, and the results of the main survey (see \Cref{Prolific Survey}), which were used to answer our research questions (\hyperref[mined-well]{RQ1} and \hyperref[modify-poor]{RQ2}) and to craft our dataset.
	
\subsubsection{Pilot Survey} \label{Pilot Survey}
	
	% Experimental setup
	\textit{1. Experimental setup:}
	We manually sampled 20 code snippets across all strata but mainly from statum 1, due to reasons mentioned in \autoref{Construction of Questionnaires}. From January 6 to 14, 2024, ten people took part in the survey. Eight of them were students and two of them worked in industry. All of them had knowledge of computer science. They were were not paid. Additionally to rating 20 code snippets the participants were also asked to answer additional questions to provide feedback about the survey:
	
	% Questions
%	They were asked the following additional questions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textit{Short answer}: How long did it take you to complete the survey?
		\item \textit{Single choice (1 (very unclear) to 5 (very clear)):} How clear was your task?
		\item \textit{Long answer:} What problems were with the task? If there were none, leave blank.
		\item \textit{Long answer:} What problems were there with the survey tool? If there were none, leave blank.
		\item \textit{Long answer:} What improvements would you make to the survey? If none, leave blank.
		\item \textit{Long answer:}  you have any other feedback? If none, leave blank.
	\end{enumerate}
	The participants answers can be found in appendix \ref{appendix:pilot-survey-feedback}.
	
	% Usage
	The feedback of the pilot survey was used in the following ways to prepare the Prolific study:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To adjust the survey texts and questions
		\item To estimate how long completion of one questionnaire will take
		\item To adjust the RDH settings
		\item To discover problems with the survey tool
		\item To discover fundamental problems with the dataset
	\end{itemize}
	
	% Threats
	\textit{2. Threats:}
	The results do not generalize. We did not sample the Java snippets for rating in a specific, (semi-) automated way, so there is a selection bias. The participants came from a private environment. This leads to a possible selection bias.
%	The survey participants were not selected among Java programmers randomly. 
	We adjusted the surveys instructions, explanations and questions afterwards, which might influence the ratings of the participants.
	However, we did not use the results from this survey to evaluate our dataset or the generation approach, as the intention of the survey was rather to prepare for the main survey. 
	
	% Results
	\textit{3. Results:}
	The results of the pilot survey were analyzed with regard to three points: the time it took to complete the survey, the feedback from the participants and the ratings of the selected code snippets.
	
	\textbf{Completion Time:} 
	In \autoref{fig:survey_times} we find the time it took the participants to complete the pilot survey and thus to rate 20 code snippets according to their readability. 
	The fastest participant completed the survey in 7 minutes and 35 seconds, while the slowest participant took 18 minutes. 
	Both the average value and the mean value are around 12 minutes. The boxplot (see \autoref{fig:survey_times}) shows that the times are close together and there are no outliers in the time taken.
	We suspect that the participants in the pilot survey put more effort into completing the survey as we know them personally. 
	Other participants may not make as much effort, so we set the time estimation for a questionnaire below average at 10 minutes.

	\textbf{Participant Feedback:}
	All feedback of the participants regarding the pilot survey is listed in Appendix~\ref{appendix:pilot-survey-feedback}.
	Most of the problems that occurred were due to the survey tool (e.g.: "I also felt that I should use the drop-down menu at the top left.").
	%	Zusammengefasst:
	%	Feature Request: "You're done! Thank you for your participation!" - message at the end
	%	Feature Request: Hide comment fields
	%	Feature Request: Predefine code parser (per survey/snippet) and hide selection during survey for participants
	%	Feature Request: Possibility to show a hint or the task description again during the survey
	Some of the feedback was regarding fully qualified class names, such as "Java.io.InputStream". We found that the pretty printer of the RDH tool specified each imported method or class with its fully specified classifier. For example, instead of "InputStream", "Java.io.InputStream" was written in the code snippets of the RDHs. This gave the participants the feeling that the code was not written by a human and drastically reduced readability. Therefore we adapted the RDH tool to print the shorter name.
	%	A potential drawback is that it can no longer be assumed that the generated code will compile and behave exactly like the original. However, the compilation-property is lost anyway during method extraction.

	\textbf{Snippet Ratings:}
	The evaluation of the last places of \autoref{tab:pilot_survey_results}, such as \textit{1.2} for \textit{stratum 1 - all}, suggests that these code snippets were particularly poorly readable. The assumption arose that they could be so poorly legible that it can no longer be assumed that they were written by a human.
	We adjusted the RDH configurations. The rating for the last places (see \autoref{tab:pilot_survey_results}), such as \textit{1.2} for \textit{Stratum 1 - all}, suggest that these code snippets were particularly poorly readable. Due to this, we re-examined the configurations of all RDHs and found that some of them are configured too strongly. This not only impairs their readability, but also makes them look as if they were not written by human hands.
	Thus, we took another close look at the RDH configurations and found that some of them are over-configured. This not only affects their readability, but also makes them look as if they were not written by human hands. We have therefore reduced the probabilities for these RDHs.
	
	We adjusted the RDH configurations and the survey tool according to the feedback. Then the Prolific study was launched.

\subsubsection{Prolific Survey} \label{Prolific Survey}
	In this section we summarize the results of the main study conducted via Prolific.
	
% TODO: Add this to the following somewhere
%	Once the survey was completed, we aggregated the ratings across all strats and all methods. We grouped the results into the 10 rdhs. In this way, we assess whether the rdhs work, which rdhs work best and how strong the impact of each rdh on readability is. In addition, we use the results of the survey to label the mined-and-modified dataset, which consists of the original and all7 rdh methods.
	
\textit{1. Experimental setup:}
	The survey was conducted using Tien Duc Nguyen's Code Annotation Tool (see \autoref{fig:survey_tool}) along with the platform Prolific\curl{https://app.prolific.com/}{2024-02-21} for the recruitment and payment of participants.
	The survey was conducted between 31 January and 7 February 2024. A total of 221 participants took part. Each of the 20 questionnaires was answered by 11 participants (similar to the survey of \citeauthor{scalabrino2018comprehensive}~\cite{scalabrino2018comprehensive}). In one survey, one more participant was assigned by mistake. 
	We estimated the time to complete one questionnaire at 10 minutes (see \autoref{Pilot Survey}). Prolific set the maximum time allowed at 44 minutes. Participants who took longer received a time-out.
	%	According to an online calculator\footnote{https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html} 
	This results in a margin of error of 29.55\% at a confidence of 95\% for an individual snippet. However, we aggregate over strata and multiple snippets later to reduce the margin of error.
	Each questionnaire consists of 20 code snippets. Consequently, 400 different code snippets are rated in total. The questionnaires were configured in a way that each participant could only take part in one of the questionnaires. You can find the texts for the survey in Appendix~\ref{appendix:prolific-survey-texts}. The questionnaires were crafted as described in \Cref{Construction of Questionnaires}.

	% Target population
	The target population consists of Java programmers selected by Prolific. They may be students or work in industry. They can come from any country. Overall, there were no requirements other than familiarity with Java.

	% Internal/Research Questions
	The internal research questions are as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Does the well-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{well-readable-assumption}) hold?
		\item Does the poorly-readable-assumption (Assumption \ref{poorly-readable-assumption}) hold?
	\end{itemize}
	
	The results for these questions are equally important, and thus none of them is prioritized over the other.
	To answer them, the assumptions	are considered as hypotheses along with the following associated null hypotheses:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For Assumption~\ref{well-readable-assumption}: The mined code (original) is on average not better readable than the code from previous studies.
		\item For Assumption~\ref{poorly-readable-assumption}: The readability of code does not significantly deteriorate compared to the original code snippet.
	\end{itemize}
	
	% Questionnaire Attributes
	The survey neither contained demographic questions nor filter questions. Besides the readability questions, each user was asked the following dependent question: "How would you describe your familiarity with Java?". The user could answer within a five point Likert scale: expert (5), advanced (4), intermediate (3), beginner (2), novice (1).
	
\textit{2. Threats:}
	We identified the following threats:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Ill-defined Target Population:} Ensuring a well-defined target population is critical to the survey's quality. To mitigate this threat, we define our target population.
		
		\item \textbf{Sampling Method:} We have a larger proportion of code snippets from strata 1 and 3 (see \autoref{Construction of Questionnaires}). While we argue that we avoided spending resources on labeling RDH data that is likely not different from the original methods or rather uninteresting, this might also introduce statistical errors to our survey results.
		However, stratified sampling is well-defined and proven in practice. The approach ensures that our sample represents all parts of the population under investigation.
%		This is improving the survey's external validity.
		
		\item \textbf{Insufficient Responses for Drawing Conclusions:} To prevent drawing conclusions from an insufficient number of responses, we scale our survey to an appropriate size. This guarantees that we collect a substantial volume of responses, allowing for robust statistical analysis.
		
		\item \textbf{Piece-work Effect:} Survey participants are paid for taking part and completing a questionnaire. However, they receive the same amount of money regardless of their speed. Therefore, they receive more pay per minute if they hurry. This could have an impact on the accuracy with which they scored the code snippets. A comparison between the time required by a participant for a pilot questionnaire and a Prolific questionnaire (see \autoref{fig:survey_times}) supports this suggestion. Especially the ratings of participants requiring less than 3 minutes (see \autoref{fig:survey_time_less_than_180}) to complete a questionnaire could have a negative impact on validity. 
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\textit{3. Results:}
	An overview of the time required by the participants can be found in the \autoref{fig:survey_times} and \autoref{fig:survey_time_histogramm}.
	The fastest participant completed the survey in 1 minute and 39 seconds, while the slowest participant took about 38 minutes. 
	The average time is 9 minutes and 45 seconds. The median time is 8 minutes and 30 seconds. The boxplot (see \autoref{fig:survey_times}) shows that the times are not as close together as for the pilot survey. There are a couple of outliers.

	The participants' familiarity with Java is shown in \autoref{fig:survey_Java_familiarity_pie}. According to their own estimation, 44.8~\% of the participants are experts with Java. Another 44.8~\% of the participants are either advanced or intermediate. This high level of familiarity with Java suggests that the quality of the evaluations received is also high.

	The ratings for each RDH for all strata combined can be found in \autoref{fig:survey_ratings_violin_all} and \autoref{fig:survey_ratings_bar_all}. 	
	In line with our expectation, we see that the ratings for \texttt{none} and \texttt{methods} are almost the same. There is no significant difference between the two, as a Mann-Whitney U test confirmed. The probability that the difference between \texttt{none} and \texttt{methods} is due to random variation is 92~\%. 
	Therefore, we are sure that other differences are actually caused by the RDHs and not by the pretty-printer.

	\autoref{fig:survey_ratings_violin_all} shows that the mean value of our original methods is 3.68. The mean score of all rated code snippets in the merged dataset is 3.45. The difference of 0.23 is significant.

%Ich würde den Absatz hierzu etwas relativieren.
%Wenn ich das richtig im Kopf habe, dann geben die meisten Classifier Modelle ja einen kontinuierlichen Wert zwischen 0 und 1 aus, was im Prinzip genau dem entspricht, was du forderst.
%Im Wesentlichen wird nur ein Knoten dahinter geschaltet, der abhängig vom Wert vorher dann eine Gruppe selektiert (</>=0.5).
%Das, was du ansprichst, zielt ja eher darauf ab, dass für die Evaluierung die binäre Klassifizierung verwendet wird.
%Und der Grund dafür ist sicherlich, dass es einfacher ist, das dazustellen, und dass man bessere Ergebnisse bekommt (das wissen denk ich auch alle, dafür brauchts nicht probably eigene research) :-) 
%Ich würd also  nur schreiben:
%- die Daten werden üblicherweise auf ner 5-point Likert scale erhoben
%- am Schluss wird als binäre Klassifizierung evaluiert
%- die Frage ist, wie dazwischen (beim Modelltraining) mit den Daten umgegangen wird. Mi machen das folgendermaßen...

	\begin{researchbox}{Summary (RQ1 - mined-well):}
		%		The readability ratings of code snippets mined from Github are not very accurate as we take the mean of all ratings for all methods and assign it to each snippet.
		The mean score for the \texttt{original} methods of the mined-and-modified dataset (3.68) is significantly larger than the mean score for all ratings in the merged dataset (3.45). Therefore we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that well readable assumption (Assumption~\ref{well-readable-assumption}) holds.
		%		and answer the research question \ref{mined-well}: Yes, automatically selected code can be assumed to be well readable.

	We analyzed whether the difference in ratings between the different RDHs is statistically significant. To do this, we used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the ratings for all snippets for an RDH with the corresponding \texttt{none} snippets. The results can be found in \autoref{tab:survey_statistical_evidence}.
	If we compare the RDHs with the \texttt{none} methods, we can be sure that the scores of all methods except newlines many and rename are indeed statistically different from the scores of \texttt{none}. 
	
	If we consider binary readability classification and split the data into two classes (poorly readable: 1,2; well readable: 3-5) all but \texttt{none} and \texttt{rename} are statistically different from each other. This includes \texttt{newlines many} (TODO: Add p Values) for which we could not confirm statistical difference without binary classification.

	Besides \texttt{none}, this leaves only \texttt{rename} where we can not confirm statistical significance. Overall, we showed that the heuristics actually reduce the readability of source code.

\subsection{Model Training Results} \label{Model training results}
	We aim to investigate the following things:
	
	% TODO: Make it "how well"
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Model evaluation:}
		To confirm that our implementation of the model scores similar accuracy as the original one of \citeauthor{mi2022towards}~\cite{mi2022towards}, we trained and evaluated the model on the merged dataset (merged-merged).
		
		\item \textbf{Internal evaluation:} 
		To investigate how effectively the model captures the readability aspects of the mined-and-modified dataset, we train and evaluate it on this dataset (mam-mam). By doing so, we examine also how effectively the model captures the differences between the \texttt{original} and \texttt{all7} methods which are modified with our RDHs.
		
		\item \textbf{Cross evaluation:} 
		To assess how effective the mined-and-modified dataset is for predicting readability, we train the model on this dataset and then evaluate its performance on the merged dataset (mam-merged). For advanced insights, we also train the model on the merged dataset and evaluate it on the merged dataset (merged-merged) and on the mined-and-modified dataset (merged-mam).
		
		\item \textbf{Fine-tuning:} 
		To assess what accuracy we can score in predicting readability, we investigate training on the mined-and-modified dataset and fine-tuning and evaluating on the merged dataset (mam-merged-merged).		
		
		% TODO: Others
	\end{enumerate}
	
	We therefore used different combinations of training and evaluation datasets with the towards mode. The results can be found in \autoref{tab:dataset_performance}. We used 10-fold cross-validation for evaluation.
		
	\begin{table}[tb]

			\midrule
			merged      & merged   	& 84.7 \% & 87.7 \% & 82.3 \% & 85.0 \% & 83.7 \% & 70.4 \% \\
			mam        	& mam    	& 91.8 \% & 92.3 \% & 91.3 \% & 91.8 \% & 91.7 \% & 83.6 \% \\
			mam			& merged    & 61.9 \% & 63.6 \% & 63.6 \% & 63.6 \% & 63.6 \% & 23.6 \% \\
			merged      & mam	    & 53.8 \% & 52.6 \% & 77.8 \% & 65.2 \% & 62.8 \% & 08.7 \% \\
			mam-merged 	& merged    & 80.4 \% & 84.0 \% & 73.8 \% & 78.9 \% & 77.2 \% & 60.0 \% \\
%			mam     	& mam  		& 80.9 \% & 82.7 \% & 77.6 \% & 80.2 \% & 78.9 \% & 60.9 \% \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\textbf{Implementation evaluation.}
	When we train and evaluate the model on the merged dataset, we obtain an accuracy of 84.7~\%. This is very similar to the results of \citeauthor{mi2022towards} (84.7~\% vs 85.3~\%). The deviation of 0.6~\% accuracy might be due to randomness of the splits for 10-fold cross-validation. We can confirm the results of the paper~\cite{mi2022towards}.
	
	\textbf{Internal evaluation.}
	When we train the model on the mined-and-modified dataset and evaluate it, we obtain an average accuracy of 91.8~\%. 
	The towards model architecture is well suited to learn the structure of the mined-and-modified dataset. In particular it learns the differences between \texttt{original} and \texttt{all7} methods and thus it learns how to predict if a code snippet has been modified using RDHs. 

	\textbf{Cross evaluation.}
	When we train the model on the mined-and-modified dataset and evaluate it on the merged dataset (mam-merged), we get an accuracy of 61.9~\%. This is 22.8~\% worse than the accuracy we get when we train and evaluate the model on the merged dataset (merged-merged). When we train the model on the merged dataset and evaluate it on the mined-and-modified one (merged-mam), we get an accuracy of 53.8~\%, which is close to the approximate accuracy of 50.0~\% of a random classifier.
	If the scores for mam-merged, merged-merged and merged-mam would be similar, we would conclude that both datasets, the merged and the mined-and-modified one, address readability in general. Given, that this is not the case and knowing for both datasets that they at least address some aspects of readability we conclude that we address different aspects of readability.
	
	%	Furthermore, the accuracy of mam-merged is 8.1~\% better than merged-mam. 
	%	This indicates that the mined-and-modified dataset includes aspects of readability that the merged dataset does not have.
	%	This indicates that our dataset is not suitable for a general classification of readability, but we may have found a subproblem. However, adding more features to reduce readability and well-designed data augmentation could overcome this limitation.
	%	We conclude, that the aspects of readability learned with the merged dataset differ from those of the mined-and-modified dataset.
	%	Otherwise, the values for merged-mam and krod-all would be similar to the value for all-all. This indicates that our dataset is not suitable for a general classification of readability, but we may have found a subproblem. However, adding more features to reduce readability and well-designed data augmentation could overcome this limitation.
	
	%	While the model trained on the mined-and-modified dataset is able to classify readability to a certain degree, the opposite is not the case, as 53.8~\%  is almost a random classifier. This suggests that fine-tuning a model trained on the mined-and-modified dataset using the entire dataset could lead to better results than the original towards model.
	
	\textbf{Fine-tuning.}
	%	We tried to overcome possible limitations by training the model on the merged-and-modified dataset and fine-tune it on the merged dataset.
	We tried to fine-tune the merged dataset by freezing different layers of the model trained with the mined-and-modified dataset. During evaluation we achieved the best results when freezing the input layers as well as the first convolution and pooling layer of all encoders. 
	However, when evaluated on the merged dataset, the performance is still worse than the merged-merged variant.
%	This is in direct contrast to our earlier assumption that such fine-tuning could lead to better results.
	One explanation for this could be that the model is too small to be effective with the larger amount of data. Introducing more or bigger layers so that the model can store more features internally could lead to an improvement. However, this is not part of this work, in which we mainly focus on a new dataset (generation approach).
	
	% TODO: Talk with lisa about 91.8~\%
	\begin{researchbox}{Summary (RQ3 - new-data):}
		When trained and evaluated on the mined-and-modified dataset we achieve an accuracy of 91.8~\%.
		When evaluated on the merged dataset, the model trained with the mined-and-modified dataset achieves an accuracy of 61.9~\%. When we train the model with merged dataset 84.7~\% is achieved.
		We concluded that the mined-and-modified dataset captures different aspects of readability. 
%		We improved the results by training with the mined-and-modified dataset and fine-tuning with the merged dataset to 80.4~\%. 
		We did not outperform the model trained only on the merged dataset.
	\end{researchbox}
	
	% TODO: Talk with Lisa about 210 ds
	%	We also trained the model with a random sample of 210 data points to gain insight into what a change in training size might do. As we can see, the model has similar metrics to the all-all model. If we now compare the accuracy of the new-new compared to the merged-merged model, we see that with a larger dataset an improvement of about 8~\% is possible. Similar results are suggested by previous research on data augmentation, where an accuracy of 87.3~\% was achieved \citeauthor{mi2021effectiveness}. This emphasizes the importance of finding new ways of generating data for readability classification. 
	
\section{Discussion} \label{Discussion}

	% Zusammenhang: Studie und Model Eval
	Our survey (see \autoref{Pilot Survey}) showed that mined-and-modified dataset captures readability. The model training results (see \autoref{Model training results}) showed that the mined-and-modified dataset captures different aspects of readability than the merged dataset. 	
	% Different aspects of readability
	The question arises what the different aspects are and whether it is possible to extend the proposed RDHs (see \autoref{Readability Decreasing Heursitcs}) so that the same aspects are captured. By achieving this we suggest that we could also achieve better evaluation results on the merged dataset than previous models.
	
	% Model Restrictions
	We fine-tuned the model with the merged dataset after training with the mined-and-modified dataset and evaluated it on the merged dataset (see \autoref{Model training results}). We expected the classification accuracy of the resulting model to exceed that of the model trained on the merged dataset only.
	Our expectations were not met. This could be because the towards model structure was designed for a much smaller data set and therefore cannot capture all the features of the mined-and-modified dataset while allowing for fine-tuning.

	% Threats
	% Merging existing datasets	
	When merging existing data sets \citeolddataset into a single dataset, we set the mean value of the ratings as the actual readability score of a data sample. As only a limited number of people participated in each survey, this may introduce errors due to statistical deviations.
	Furthermore, the surveys were conducted under different conditions, e.g. different raters, different number of raters per snippet, different rater biases, different code scopes. When merging the data sets, we do not take these inequalities into account. This could lead to a bias in the merged dataset. However, previous approaches did this similarly.
	
	% Mean assignment
	A drawback of our approach is that we rely on estimations to create the mined-and-modified dataset. The score labels of our code snippets are rough estimations and not exact values. Accurate ratings would require manual review of \numSamples code snippets by human annotators and is therefore not feasible. However, for two class classification this does not matter.
	
	% Model threats	
	When comparing the model performance trained on the mined-and-modified and merged dataset, it should be noted that the merged data set is small. Consequently, comparisons between classifiers trained on the merged dataset may be unreliable~\cite{mi2022towards}.
	
\section{Conclusions} \label{Conclusions}
	% Summary with Implications: So what?	
	Recent research in the field of code readability classification has mainly focused on various deep learning model architectures to further improve accuracy. Little attention is paid to the fact that only 421 labeled code snippets are available to train these models. We introduced a novel approach to generate data, with which we created a dataset of \numSamples code snippets. Although our results show that the dataset does not have the same quality as previous data, it still captures the readability of code and could accordingly help to improve code classification in future research.
	
	% Future work	
	% New dataset style
	The new approach for generating data has an advantage that is not yet used in this work: For the first time, it is possible to generate a dataset with one well readable and a second, less readable and functionally equivalent code snippet. This could be used to train various models, including transformers. Such a transformer could take the code as input and improve its readability. We suspect that such a tool could be of great benefit to programmers.
	
	% Languages	
	A current limitation of the mined-and-modified dataset is that it only works for Java code. A suggestion for future work is to overcome this limitation by extending the tool for other programming languages. This is not trivial, as one has to adapt the Readability Decreasing Heuristics to work with another language. Furthermore, a general tool that works for all languages will be difficult if not impossible.
	
	% More surveys	
	%	To further improve the readability estimates for both the good and poorly readable code, further surveys could be conducted. By splitting the code snippets into more granular clusters and obtaining a more accurate average by asking more people about the readability of the code within the same cluster, one can increase the accuracy of the label estimation. Such an improvement can then in turn improve the predictions of the model as it learns from this data.
	
	% Syntax Tree	
	As \citeauthor{mi2023graph} suggested, another useful representation for code readability studies could be the syntax tree representation of code~\cite{mi2023graph}. One could try to improve the performance of the towards model by adding another representation encoding extractor for Java code that automatically extracts the abstract syntax tree of the code.
	
	% Method name fitting
	An important aspect of the readability of code is the naming. For the scope of methods, the method names are the most important part. Therefore, the towards model could be improved by adding a component that explicitly takes into account how well a method name matches its body. This component might be similar to Code2vec~\cite{alon2019code2vec}.
	
	% Other encodings
	Further research could also consist of finding and evaluating other encodings that represents the code in a different way.
	
	% Other model structure
	Another way to improve existing code readability classifiers, such as the towards model, could be to develop a different structure for some layers of the model. We suggest increasing the size and depth of the layers so that the mined-and-modified dataset can be made useful. Alternatively, a completely different model architecture could be developed. 
	
	% More heuristics
	The heuristics described in this work are only part of the possible heuristics that could be developed. Additional heuristics could further improve the diversity of poorly readable code. This could increase the number of internal features that a model can learn, which in turn could increase the accuracy of the model.
	
	% Summary
	In summary, there are many opportunities to further investigate and thus most likely improve the classification of code readability. Our new data set and the generation approach could be useful here.

	\textbf{What problems were with the task? If there were none, leave blank.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Did at first not know where to rate the code.
		\item I was confused about the textfield for the comments because I only remembered that we should rate the code snippets, not that we have to make comments. Since I was not able to navigate back to the task description, I did not know what to do with them.
		\item Für einen Anfänger mit sehr wenig Java Erfahrung ist meiner Meinung nach der Code zu kompliziert.
		\item In the first place, I didn't really understand what readability meant. But after slide 3 or 4, I understood what this was about.
		\item I found it difficult to categorize the first examples because you don't know what's still to come. For example, what the least readable code is.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{What problems were there with the survey tool? If there were none, leave blank.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mobile is not easy to use because of the scrolling needed to complete the survey.
		\item First, I needed to figure out how this tool works and that the rating is done with the stars below. I thought I should write my rating as a comment in the comment field below. After number 20, I didn't know whether I could close the survey or not.
		\item I also thought that I should use the drop-down menu on the upper left.
		\item It is sometimes necessary to swipe horizontally to see all of the code, which is a bit inconvenient.
		\item Für einen Anfänger ist das Tool meiner Meinung nach nicht geeignet. Der Code ist zu verschachtelt und teilweise unverständlich.
		\item After finishing the task, at least a message should be shown.
		\item I didn't understand what the button at the top left meant, where you could select the programming language. There were too many fonts to choose. I also wasn't sure whether to write a comment or not. It wasn't described at the beginning.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{What improvements would you make to the survey? If none, leave blank.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maybe one sentence that one should use the stars for the rating, then it would be clear. Also, the submit note after the last question could contain that one can close the survey now.
		\item I suggest making the task description accessible during the rating.
		\item Maybe the option to leave the survey when clicking to submit.
		\item Mehr Hilfestellung zum Lesen des Codes. Mehr Beschreibung oder ein zusätzliches Cheat Sheet mit Bedeutungen von Befehlen.
		\item I think it's a good idea to ask the participant at the beginning to explain what readability means for him.
		\item I would leave out the buttons described above. I was missing a scrollbar at the bottom of the code-window. A conclusion page with a message like "Thank you for your participation", "You're Done!" or other further information was missing, too.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Do you have any other feedback? If none, leave blank.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There were drop downs for the programming language, but choosing another language did not change anything. It was a bit confusing that (almost?) all code snippets had very long imports within the code, which made them poorly readable.
		\item I spent the most time understanding methods with complete Java import names. (org.foo.bar.ClassName).
		\item GOOD LUCK
